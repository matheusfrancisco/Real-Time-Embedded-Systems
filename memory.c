 *
 * This is a simple dynamic memory allocation module. The following are the 
 * supported services:
 *
 * unsigned char * NEAR SRAMalloc(NEAR unsigned char nBytes) 
 * void SRAMfree(unsigned char * NEAR pSRAM)
 * void SRAMInitHeap(void)
 *
 * This version of the dynamic memory allocation limits the segment size
 * to 126 bytes. This is specifically designed such to enable better
 * performance by limiting pointer manipulation.
 *
 *
 * How it works:
 * The model is based on a simple form of a linked list. A block of memory
 * refered to as the dynamic heap is split into segments. Each segment 
 * has a single byte header that references the next segment in the list
 * as well as indicating whether the segment is allocated. Consiquently 
 * the reference implicitly identifies the length of the segment. 
 *
 * This method also enables the possibility of allowing a large number
 * of memory allocations. The maximum is limited by the defined heap size.
 *
 * SRAMalloc() is used to split or merge segments to be allocated.
 * SRAMfree() is used to release segments.
 * 
 * Example:
 *	----------
 *	|  0x7F  |	0x200   Header Seg1
 *	|        |
 *	|        |
 *	|        |
 *	|        | 
 *	|        |
 *	|        |
 *	|  0x89  |  0x27F	Header Seg2 (allocated)
 *	|        |
 *	|        |
 *	|  0x77  |  0x288	Header Seg3
 *	|        |
 *	|        |
 *	|        |
 *	|        |
 *	|        |
 *	|        |
 *	|        |
 *	|  0x00  |	0x2FF 	Tail
 *	----------

 *	
 *	Bit 7	Bit 6 	Bit 5	Bit 4	Bit 3	Bit 2	Bit 1	Bit 0
 *	
 *	Alloc	------------- reference to next Header --------------
 *
 *	
 * Recomendations:
 * Although this model will allow dynamic allocation down to a single byte,
 * doing so sacrifices performance. With more segments within the heap, more
 * time is required to attempt to allocate memory. Plus every segment requires 
 * a header byte; therefore, smaller segments require more memory. There is 
 * also the possibility of fragmentation, which could ultimately doom an 
 * application by reducing the largest allocatable block of memory. Thus the 
 * recomendation is to allocate at least 8 bytes of memory.
